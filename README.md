# Open_Source_Contributions

While looking for something open source to contribute to, there are two important things for me. 
-- Code should be written in python as it is my primary language
-- It should be a library that is of some significance of me(either im using it or im planning to learn it)

# My fields of interest 
-- Computer vision
\
		-- Image processing
\ 
		-- OpenCV
\
	-- Deep learning
\
		-- Pytorch
\
-- 3D computer vision
\
	-- 3D data algorithms(point cloud, meshes)
		--Trimesh
	-- 3D deep learning
		-- Pytorch 3d
		-- Kaolin

Next Step.
	-- Read pytorch3d and understand how code is managed.
	-- Find some fucntions which are not there and are helpful.


We are going to talk about one startup with open source code in AI here.

Day 1: Kornia-- Differentiable functions for image processing so that they can be used in a neural network.

Trends: A lot of startups are working on MLOps.
LLMs are big thing now giving rise to large foundational models.
